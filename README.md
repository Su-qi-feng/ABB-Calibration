# ABB-Calibration
The dataset of robot calibration
This position data of ABB IRB 120 robot can be used for robot calibration We provide ABB-Calibration.xlsx with 600 sample points of ABB IRB 120 robot, which can be used for the verification of manipulator calibration algorithm. You can read the following papers to understand the principle and methods of manipulator calibration. Here, x, y, z are the coordinates of the position of the robotâ€™s end-effector in the base coordinate system, L is the length of the cable, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 are the joint angles of the robot.
